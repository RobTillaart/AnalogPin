# AnalogPin

Arduino library to add functionality on top of analogRead().


## Description

AnalogPin is an Arduino class that adds noise filtering and smoothing to analogRead().
Furthermore it can speed up the analogRead() function by tuning the pre-scaler.
This latter is AVR only.


## Interface

- **AnalogPin(uint8_t pin)** constructor with analogue pin as parameter.
- **void setPrescaler(uint8_t prescale = 7)** AVR only pre-scaler.
- **uint8_t getPrescaler()** return pre-scaler set.
- **void  setNoiseThreshold(uint8_t noise = 0)** set noise level that should be ignored. Typical 0..2.
- **uint8_t getNoiseThreshold()** return set value.
- **void setSmoothWeight(uint8_t alpha = 0)** alpha = 0..31, parameter for low pass filter.
- **uint8_t getSmoothWeight(void)** returns set alpha.
- **int read(bool twice = false)** read function, optional read twice to stabilize.
- **int readSmoothed()** read version that uses low pass filter.
- **int readPrevious()** returns previous read value.
- **int readLast()** returns last read value without reading a new one.


## Operation

**get/setPrescaler(uint8_t prescale)** can be used to speed up analogRead().  
The effect is that both the accuracy and precision are affected.
You should verify if this is acceptable for your project.
***Works only for AVR based boards***

**get/setNoiseThreshold(uint8_t noise)** is used to set the noise threshold to be used by the **read()** function.

**read(bool twice)** implements an **analogRead()** that suppresses small noise fluctuations.
The parameter twice is used to force analogRead() to be executed twice to reduce noise from the multiplexing.

Example: if the previous read has the value 300 and you
want to interpret all subsequent readings between 290
and 310 as 300 (the same) your code should look like:
```
    AP.setNoiseThreshold(10);
    AP.read();
```

**get/setSmoothWeight(uint8_t alpha)** is used to set the weight factor for the **readSmoothed()** function.

The weight of the previous read is **alpha/32**.
A higher alpha will dampen the signal more, a lower alpha
will follow the actual signal better.
This can be used to suppress noise too.

```
    AP.setSmoothWeight(4);   // weight = 4/32 = 1/8 = 12.5%
    AP.readSmoothed();
```

**readSmoothed()** implements an analogRead with a running average build in.


## Future

- update documentation
  - advantage of certain functions, when to use
- more examples
- **volts()** + get/setFactor(float f)
- move code to .cpp
